# Vulnerability Assessment

## Overview

The Vulnerability Assessment project provides a comprehensive set of tools and scripts for detecting, analyzing, and reporting security vulnerabilities in software systems. Designed for security professionals and developers, this repository helps identify weaknesses in applications and systems, enabling proactive security measures and remediation.

## Features

- **Automated Scanning**: Automatically detect vulnerabilities using a set of predefined rules and heuristics.
- **Customizable Rules**: Adapt and extend vulnerability detection rules to suit specific needs and threat models.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generate detailed reports with vulnerability descriptions, severity levels, and remediation recommendations.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with CI/CD pipelines for continuous security assessments.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Compatible with various operating systems and environments.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**: Ensure Python 3.7 or higher is installed on your system.
- **Pip**: Python package installer (usually included with Python installations).

### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vijaykumargowdakk/Vulnerability-assessment.git
cd Vulnerability-assessment
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Scanning

To perform a basic scan of a target URL, use the following command:

```bash
python scan.py --target <target-url>
```

Replace `<target-url>` with the URL of the application or system you wish to scan. This command will run the default vulnerability detection rules against the specified target.

### Advanced Scanning

For more advanced scanning options, such as specifying scan types or adjusting scan parameters, use:

```bash
python scan.py --target <target-url> --scan-type <type> --depth <level>
```

- `--scan-type <type>`: Choose the type of scan (e.g., `full`, `quick`).
- `--depth <level>`: Specify the depth of the scan (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`).

### Custom Rule Configuration

To create or modify custom vulnerability detection rules, edit the `config/rules.json` file. This JSON file allows you to define and adjust detection rules according to your specific requirements. After updating the rules, run the scan again to apply the changes.

### Generating Reports

Generate detailed vulnerability reports using the following command:

```bash
python report.py --format <report-format> --output <output-file>
```

- `--format <report-format>`: Specify the report format (e.g., `html`, `pdf`, `json`).
- `--output <output-file>`: Define the filename and location for the generated report.

## Configuration

### Configuration File

The main configuration file is located at `config/settings.json`. This file allows you to adjust various settings related to scanning behavior, such as timeouts, retries, and logging levels. Example:

```json
{
  "timeout": 30,
  "retries": 3,
  "log_level": "INFO"
}
```

### Rule File

The rule file `config/rules.json` contains the vulnerability detection rules. You can define rules in this file to tailor the scanning process to your specific needs.
